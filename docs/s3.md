title: S3 Uploader

Let's say you want to upload a file to one of your S3 buckets, using __POST__.

Your API has a protected endpoint that returns the necessary S3 upload params. Maybe it [uses Boto](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.generate_presigned_post) to generate a [presigned upload URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html).

A successful request to this endpoint returns something like this:

~~~json
{
  "fields": {
    "AWSAccessKeyId": "AKIAJSQUO7ORWYVCSV6Q",
    "acl": "public-read",
    "key": "files/89789486-d94a-4251-a42d-18af752ab7d2-test.txt",
    "policy": "eyJleHBpcmF0aW9uIjogIjIwMTgtMTAtMzBUMjM6MTk6NDdaIiwgImNvbmRpdGlvbnMiOiBbeyJhY2wiOiAicHVibGljLXJlYWQifSwgWyJjb250ZW50LWxlbmd0aC1yYW5nZSIsIDEwLCAzMTQ1NzI4MF0sIHsiYnVja2V0IjogImJlYW10ZWNoLWZpbGUifSwgeyJrZXkiOiAiY29tcGFueS8zLzg5Nzg5NDg2LWQ5NGEtNDI1MS1hNDJkLTE4YWY3NTJhYjdkMi10ZXN0LnR4dCJ9XX0=",
    "signature": "L7r3KBtyOXjUKy31g42JTYb1sio="
  },
  "fileUrl": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/files/89789486-d94a-4251-a42d-18af752ab7d2-test.txt",
  "uploadUrl": "https://my-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/"
}
~~~

`fields` has everything you need to authenticate with your S3 bucket, but you need to add them to the request sent by RDU. It turns out this is super easy.

~~~js
const getUploadParams = async ({ meta: { name } }) => {
  const { fields, uploadUrl, fileUrl } = await myApiService.getPresignedUploadParams(name)
  return { fields, meta: { fileUrl }, url: uploadUrl }
}
~~~

That's it. If `myApiService.getPresignedUploadParams` succeeds, you return `uploadUrl` as `url`. You also decide to merge `fileUrl` into your file's meta so you can use it later. RDU takes care of the rest, including appending the fields to the `FormData` instance used in the `XMLHttpRequest`.

Let's say `myApiService.getPresignedUploadParams` fails and returns `{}`. In this case `uploadUrl` and hence `url` are undefined. RDU abandons the upload and changes the file's status to `'error_upload_params'`. At this point you might show the user an error message, and the user might remove the file or restart the upload.


## S3 using PUT instead of POST
Uploading a file to S3 using __PUT__ works differently than using __POST__.

Basically, if you use PUT, you can't wrap your file in a `FormData` instance. In this case, `body` must be set to `file`, and the `fields` in the POST example are all encoded in the query string of the `uploadUrl`. `getUploadParams` would look a little different:

~~~js
const getUploadParams = async ({ file, meta: { name } }) => {
  const { uploadUrl, fileUrl } = await myApiService.getPresignedUploadParams(name)
  return { body: file, meta: { fileUrl }, url: uploadUrl }
}
~~~
