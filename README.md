## Documentation
<https://react-dropzone-uploader.js.org>


## Installation
`npm install --save react-dropzone-uploader`

Import default styles in your app.

~~~js
import 'react-dropzone-uploader/dist/styles.css'
~~~


## Quick Start
RDU handles common use cases with almost no config. The following code gives you a dropzone and clickable file input that accepts image, audio and video files. It uploads files to `https://httpbin.org/post`, and renders a button to submit files that are done uploading. [Check out a live demo](https://react-dropzone-uploader.js.org/docs/quick-start).

~~~js
import 'react-dropzone-uploader/dist/styles.css'
import Dropzone from 'react-dropzone-uploader'

const MyUploader = () => {
  // specify upload params and url for your files
  const getUploadParams = ({ meta }) => { return { url: 'https://httpbin.org/post' } }
  
  // called every time a file's `status` changes
  const handleChangeStatus = ({ meta, file }, status) => { console.log(status, meta, file) }
  
  // receives array of files that are done uploading when submit button is clicked
  const handleSubmit = (files) => { console.log(files.map(f => f.meta)) }

  return (
    <Dropzone
      getUploadParams={getUploadParams}
      onChangeStatus={handleChangeStatus}
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      accept="image/*,audio/*,video/*"
    />
  )
}

## Contributing
There are a number of places RDU could be improved; [see here](https://github.com/fortana-co/react-dropzone-uploader/labels/help%20wanted).

For example, RDU has solid core functionality, but has a minimalist look and feel. It would be more beginner-friendly with a larger variety of built-in components.


### Shout Outs
Thanks to @nchen63 for helping with [TypeScript defs](https://github.com/fortana-co/react-dropzone-uploader/blob/master/src/Dropzone.d.ts)!


### Running Dev
Clone the project, install dependencies, and run the dev server.

~~~sh
git clone git://github.com/fortana-co/react-dropzone-uploader.git
cd react-dropzone-uploader
yarn
npm run dev
~~~

This runs code in `examples/src/index.js`, which has many examples that use `Dropzone`. The library source code is in the `/src` directory.


## Thanks
Thanks to `react-dropzone`, `react-select`, and `redux-form` for inspiration.
